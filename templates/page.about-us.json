To this, add <strong>1\/2 cup<\/strong> or <strong>60g<\/strong> of <strong>whole-wheat flour<\/strong>. Using the silicone spatula from the kit, mix the ingredients until you achieve a smooth consistency. This mixture is the foundation of your sourdough starter. Once mixed, cover the jar with the cloth liner, ensuring it’s secure but can still breathe. Find a warm spot in your home, ideally between <strong>75-80°F (24-26°C)<\/strong>, and let your mixture sit. This warmth is crucial as it encourages the natural yeasts and bacteria in the flour to start fermenting.<\/p><p><strong>Day 2:<\/strong> By the second day, you might notice slight changes in your mixture. It might have a few bubbles, and there could be a hint of a tangy aroma. This is a sign that the fermentation process has begun. Stir the mixture gently and then re-cover it with the cloth liner. Let it sit in its warm spot.<\/p><p><strong>Days 3 to 7:<\/strong> Over the next five days, your starter will need a bit more attention. Each day, give the mixture a good stir. Then, discard half of it. This discard process is essential to ensure that the growing yeast remains active and vigorous. After discarding, add <strong>1\/4 cup<\/strong> or <strong>50g<\/strong> of <strong>water<\/strong> and <strong>1\/3 cup<\/strong> or <strong>50g<\/strong> of <strong>whole-wheat flour<\/strong> to the jar. Mix well using the silicone spatula, ensuring there are no dry patches of flour. Once mixed, cover the jar again with the cloth liner. The day tracker band from the kit is a handy tool at this stage. Use it to mark the mixture’s starting level and to keep track of the feeding day and time. As the days progress, the mixture should become more bubbly and double in volume, indicating it’s ready for baking.<\/p>","text_size":"regular"}}},"block_order":["template--16404833140890__4e9973b9-c2d0-4279-947d-519baeb7a7e5-title-1","template--16404833140890__4e9973b9-c2d0-4279-947d-519baeb7a7e5-text-1","6b21677c-6378-4ed0-b7c5-156e573bd83b","7f625205-c895-400d-a09c-b243dc403e26","3c00add1-e9fa-42f9-bf83-ca2b5f97030a","ce5c237d-b736-4579-8e1c-c0b9c4f60699","4e489fbf-006c-4e34-ba82-b0387ca5ae72","25cea02f-e1fa-43c2-ae7f-427f7c540d81"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"image_position":"top no-image","height":"regular","image_crop":true,"text_alignment":"horizontal-left","is_fullwidth":false,"section_background_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","remove_margin":false,"color_background_main":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_text_main":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_accent_main":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_borders_main":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_shadow_main":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_hide_borders":false,"color_hide_shadow":false}},"a21ec9f5-dbac-4fc3-8452-e9243fdec051":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"2b2d6593-16b7-4216-b2d5-a7e4195b0bbf":{"type":"title","settings":{"title":"Maintaining Your Sourdough Starte","title_size":"h3","seo_h_tag":"h2"}},"15d786d8-0975-469e-9681-0e3a455766d3":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Once your sourdough starter is active, bubbly, and ready to go, maintaining its health becomes your next important task.
